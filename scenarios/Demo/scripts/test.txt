This is some testing text. This event should be reached first when testing branches and conditions.
This is a new line for testing formatting.{if_event:soup| I see you found the soup event, good job!|}
This line has a branch with 3 choices.{branch|choice_1:Adds a script to this event|choice_2:Enables an event|choice_3:Enables stuff in next event}More text on the same line to test newlines.
This is a bunch of text after the choice to check if the math I did was correct.
